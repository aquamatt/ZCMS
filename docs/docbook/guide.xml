                There are as many definitions of what a CMS is as there are people with content
                to manage. The zCMS package is a Django application that manages templates and other
                content in a database and which has a concept of content belonging to different channels
                and being written for different languages.

                zCMS can manage content and templates for any third party system, but it has been 
                implemented with a slight skew towards Django templates. To this end the zCMS package
                provides some Django template tags to facilitate working with the CMS.
