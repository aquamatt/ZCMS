ZCMS is a very, very basic CMS. It is not:

* enhanced with cacheing
* very featureful
* in anyway intended to be 'good'

It is:
* a toy with which to learn
* handy for very small sites, if you like that sort of thing
* an experimental play thing

It was written to scratch an itch about CMS for multi-channel, multi-lingual content.
In this bundle you have:

(a) The zcms application under apps. This is all you need to add ZCMS to your Django
    applications
(b) The mycms demo site which implements the zcms 

To use ZCMS, make sure the app is on the python path and do the following:

1) Settings
	a) Add to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:   "zcms.middleware.ZCMSMiddleware"
	b) Add zcms to INSTALLED_APPS
	c) Add something like the following to your URLS:
	   (r'^zcms/', include("zcms.urls")),
	   
2) syncdb

You can now play around. How exactly? Well, consider the mycms application first to see how it 
works. Once the apps folder is in the python path and you've made the MySQL database (see 
settings.py for credentials - adjust to suit) do a syncdb. Then source the datase in test_db
(created with mysqldump) to bring in a very poor test site. You can see the content
in admin and see the site in action on the root URL.
